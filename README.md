# NPC Dialog Demo

## üìö Overview
This repo contains a library that allows you to create NPCs that you can talk to. Built for Stormworks: Build and Rescue.

Utilizes [my framework](https://github.com/Cuh4/AuroraFramework).

## üòî Limitations
- NPCs are not persistent. If you create a NPC, and then reload the addon, the NPC will have to be created again
- To start a conversation with a NPC, you can only say one thing. After that, you can say multiple things to progress through the conversation depending on the NPC's dialog.
- Dialogs cannot be natively linked to one another. Each dialog has their own route.

## ‚ùì Requirements
- **Python 3.11+**
- **Stormworks: Build and Rescue** (game)

## üíª Setup
1) Run `git clone "https://github.com/Cuh4/NPCDialogDemo.git" "%appdata%/Stormworks/data/missions/NPCDialogDemo"`
2) Create a `playlist.xml` file containing the content below.
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<playlist file_store="4" name="Addon Name Here">
    <locations>
        <locations/>
    </locations>
</playlist>
```
3) Run `py combiner.py` (or run `combiner.bat`) to create a `script.lua` file. Feel free to close it once it has been created.
4) Create a save with the addon enabled, and test away.
